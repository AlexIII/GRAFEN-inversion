# Gravity inversion script example using [GRAFEN](https://github.com/AlexIII/GRAFEN/tree/topo+layered)

## Usage

Workload is defined as a directory with config, measured gravity field data and a height map.

```
./grafen-inversion.py workload_dir [init | solve | continue]
    workload_dir/
        target_field*.grd
        topo_hieghtmap*.grd
        config.txt
            n_layers = 81
            [l0 = 60]
            [pprr = 100] # Point Potential Replace Radius, -1 for no PPRR
```
